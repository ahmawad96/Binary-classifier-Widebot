# Binary-classifier-Widebot
* This is an evaluation task by Widebot. (https://widebot.net/)
* Using statistical machine learning models to fit the given training data and then evaluate models performance on the given Validation data.
* I didn't try using neural networks because they are data hungry and perform better than statistical algorithms only on large scale datasets.

## Notes:
* An HTML version of the notebook is provided for viewing the project without need to install jupyter notebook.
